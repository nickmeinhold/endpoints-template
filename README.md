A template for a Google Cloud Endpoints app in Java, using Objectify to access the datastore. 

1. Create a new project with maven. 

1. Create a new project with cloud console:

    1. Visit the [Google Developers Console](https://console.developers.google.com) and click **Create Project**.

    1. In the *New Project* dialog, assign some name for the project. It doesn't have to match the name you assign to your Maven project. Accept the project ID or make up your own.

    1. Click **Create** to create the project.

    1. Note the project ID, as you'll need it later. 

    1. Click **APIs & auth > Credentials > Create new Client ID**.

    1. Fill out the Create Client ID form:

        1. Select **Web application** as the Application Type.
        1. Specify (eg.) https://endpoints-template.appspot.com (for live app, note https) and http://localhost:8080 (for local testing, note http) in the textbox labeled AUTHORIZED JAVASCRIPT ORIGINS.
        1. Click **Create Client ID**.
        1. Keep this tab open so you can look up the client and project IDs later.

1. Update the value of `application` in `appengine-web.xml` to the project id previously registered.

1. Optional step: These sub steps are not required but you need to do this if you want to use auth protected API methods.

    1. Update the values in `src/main/java/co/enspyr/endpointstemplate/Constants.java`
       to reflect the respective client IDs you have registered in the
       [APIs Console][6].

    1. Update the value of `google.devrel.samples.helloendpoints.CLIENT_ID`
       in `src/main/webapp/base.js` to reflect the web client ID you have
       registered in the [APIs Console][4].

1. Run the application with `mvn appengine:devserver`, and ensure it's
   running by visiting your local server's address (by default
   [localhost:8080][5].)

1. Get the client library with

   $ mvn appengine:endpoints_get_client_lib

   It will generate a jar file named something like
   `helloworld-v1-1.18.0-rc-SNAPSHOT.jar` under the
   `target/endpoints-client-libs/<api-name>/target` directory of your
   project, as well as install the artifact into your local maven
   repository.

1. Deploy your application to Google App Engine with

   $ mvn appengine:update
